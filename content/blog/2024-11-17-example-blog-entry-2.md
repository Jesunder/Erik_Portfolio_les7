## Welcome to My Portfolio
Hi, I’m Erik—a passionate designer, 3D modeler, and programmer. With a strong foundation in creativity and precision, I specialize in crafting visually compelling designs, realistic 3D models, and functional digital solutions.

<br>

Through my work, I aim to merge form and function, delivering results that not only look stunning but also solve problems effectively. Explore my portfolio to see projects ranging from intricate 3D designs to interactive applications.

<br>

Let’s bring ideas to life together!
